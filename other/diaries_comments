id 13P079B monitoring starts 19.3. around 15.00, but then the diary is noted as starting on thursday 19.3. at 00.00 and indeed 2009 19.3. was thursday, but diary could not have started at 00.00 already since monitoring started at 15.00, could it be that the mother mixed it up and meant to write as 20.3. 00.00?
also there are some comments where the no wear time can be noted that I cant read or understand and dont know to which monitor do they refer, is bältet is the mothers hip monitor?
and the second day of feeding has some weird notations at the end, one input before the last is noted as starting at 21.0F, i dont know what is that supposed to mean, i tried guessing which number could it be, but it really doesnt look like anything else but F and is noted as lasting 110 and i dont know 110 of what , minutes sounds a bit long? and then the final notation is noted as if it start the same as the one before, so 21.0F and is it supposed to last 2nsk...i dont know how to put these two entries in the table?

id 37P075B has some text where no-wear notations should be, I think it is trying to say that the monitor pants were taken off only when nappy was changed and then put back on, so none of that was noted and then there are two inputs of monitor removal, only first is important and it comes with a note, I am not able to read, I think it says: "tags av trä?tad?s.torkad?s, i dont know what the letters where i put question marks are supposed to be..but something was happening with the monitor at that time, because in the plots I see baseline changes and movement and also some slope in the signal which should not be there if the monitor was just laying still on surface...
there is also some notes by the sleeping schedule 20 min and something that doesnt look like swedish alphabet 
in the end(final page) comments, I cant really read and understand everything, there is something about the same day they got the monitor, they gave the infant something milky? and then I cant read and understand something with mamma and 5h for the evening and that it went well and the infant slept extra long thursday night...?

id 70P079B1 had only commented that they had taken the infant pants monitor off for nappy change, but no exact times are noted, same for twin id 70P079B2
two feeding periods in both twins are overlapping, two times are different by a few minutes, like id 70P079B1 is supposed to start 17.10 and stop first feeding at 20.44 and start second at 19.50, but personaly I think the mother was being very inaccurate with the timing, since she wrote for both twins that they were eating NAN for 210 min 3 times in a row...

id 75P077 has noted that the pants monitor was taken of just at nappy changes and no times are noted, then on the second page there is a note about something in the badhus and taking of a monitor, it says bälte for monitor, but torso and ankle show obvious no wear time at the end of the 48 h period, around the 46th hour...
also sleeping is noted as starting on 12.2.2009 at 00.00, but that was thursday and notations start on wednesday, which was the first day of monitoring...


id 78P083B has mixed notation in the feeding diary, one feeding is supposed to be from 8.45 and lasting 35 minutes (till 9.20), but then the entry after that is supposed to start 9.00 lasting 10 minutes...

id 80P077 has second day of feeding diary noted only up till 12.30, rest of the day is missing

id 81P180 has a weird notation for the sleep on second to third night, the mother made the line over the date, but no line for the second day night...also for the no wear time, she noted that the pants monitor were taken of for bath, just around the 48th hour, but signal does not indicate that what so ever, at that particular time, although the ankle signal does so a little bit more...

id 84P077 I dont know for which monitor do the notes on the first page apply...mothers wrist monitor is noted as missing in the ids files any way, infant doesnt seem to have any no wear time judging from the signal...

id 86P079B in the second page of no wear notations, I cant read the handwritting and am not sure for wich monitor they apply, fotled is supposed to be ankle?

id 103P076 noted that it was hard to know the exact times the child was sleeping along with some other notes I cant read, the diary is quite messy 


id 111P082 first page of no wear notations, doesnt say for which monitor the note is for, from the data it looks like it is the mothers wrist, the second page of no wear notes I cant read out what it says and when it was supposed to begin...

id 114P076 also noted that the infant torso monitor taken off at nappy changes , but no times are specified, and something about the pants being forgotten on midsommar weekend

id 115P075 noted that they were aerating infants bum twice, once noted for half an hour, second not specifici, neither is detected by the no wear detection... also the sleeping schedule has some notes, that I have trouble reading and understanding whether they are relevant at all...

id 116P078 noted that they had forgotten to put the monitor back on after a nappy cahnge, but the time noted is early morning and it looks like that was when they remembered to put it back on, judging from the data(plots and no-wear detection)...also sleeping diary has some messy notation, double lines and such...

id 118P084 has extensive notes at sleeping schedule that I cant read and understand completly, the infant was vaccinated and i am not sure whether it had affected the habitual sleeping and eating, but that is seen from the marked schedule or is that is something extra that the marked shedule doesnt show...also at the bottom notations, I dont get it, what it is supposed to be all about, something about eating and food habits...
