Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion

The accelerometer data was recorded in a free living environment for 48 hours using a GENEA tri-axial monitor(UniLever Ltd), sampled at 40 Hz and stored in g units. The diary consist of printed forms which the mothers filled out for five consecutive days from midnight of the second day on, example in Supplements-----refer to exact supplement


In order to analyze and process all this information, the tri-axial accelerometer data needed to be prepared and preprocessed. The first and basic task was to organize the raw accelerometer data which are stored in comma-separated files as well as binary files in order to enable analyses to be performed for all subjects individually or as mother-infant pairs. The infant and maternal accelerometers did not start measuring at the exact same time, for this reason  the corresponding set of accelerometer data for each mother-infant pair needed to be aligned according to timestamps, to ensure they represent accelerations recorded at the same time. This was followed by data preprocessing, which started with removal of the data points belonging to the time when the accelerometer was not actually worn (i.e. non-wear time). Long durations of non-wear time could impose a low PA value due to the lack of accelerations in the overall measured time frame. The beginning and end timestamps of the detected non-wear blocks were validated against the diary notations of accelerometer removal and reattachment. The next step required a summary measure to be extracted. For this purpose, data from each of the three axes were first filtered with a median filter of width 11, then 1 was subtracted from the Euclidean norm of all three axes and in the end the measure was averaged over 0.2 second windows, similar as done in previous analysis[2]. The subtracted 1 represents an estimation of the gravitational component, since the acceleration output is measured in gs, where 1g ≃ 9.81 m/s2. But as analyzed and discussed in previous papers[3], removing the gravitational component is not so simple, especially when rotational movements are present. In this project, this problem was approached with the signal baseline correction method[4], which preserves all the amplitudes, but corrects the signal baseline drifts or displacements. The final step of preprocessing was to correct for the accelerations contributed by the caretaker. Besides one published paper[1] and a PhD thesis[6] along with a conference abstract[5], this issue has not yet been researched and therefor has no established approach of solving. For this reason, various approaches were tested in this project. From simple subtraction of accelerations measured at torso from the accelerations measured on the ankle, to simple but more advanced approaches like subtracting the windowed intensities or using the windowed intensities to reduce the acceleration values in the ankle measurement, to more complicated attempts of correction by extracting windowed signal similarities between the measurements of torso and ankle, along with the approach where all the blocks detected as infant being moved are simply excluded from the further analysis and PA extraction. Each approach has drawbacks which expose the nature of the accelerometer output taken of an infant from monitors placed on different body parts. Blocks, where infant was being moved, were approximated along with a set of variables, representing the overall duration, intensity and frequency of the caretakers contributions. These variables were used to analyze the results from different approaches and could as well be used as covariates in future analyses of PA and the correlation with other characteristics. The results were also compared with the diary notations of sleeping and feeding habits with an intention of validation. 
From the remaining or corrected raw accelerometer data, PA was extracted and compared against the diary notations of sleeping habits, with the intention to examine the overall activity, specifically whether it is more present during infants awake time as expected. The project report ends with a discussion and conclusions regarding estimations of infants PA and the feasibility of estimating infants PA by placing two accelerometers on the infant in order to correct for the contributions of the caretaker.

When conducting analysis over a complex dataset, where the subjects are in fact two or more paired individuals or a combination of their measures that require preprocessing, the dataset has to be organized in order to enable same preprocessing scripts to be run for each pair representing the individual subject of the analysis. Usually that simply means that the files containing the data need to be named appropriately, by containing a number corresponding to the ordered sequence of numbers representing the set of subjects. When the data to be processed is a time series, very often the exact absolute time is important, especially when comparing measurements of the same characteristic, but from different monitors. For that purpose measurements usually include corresponding timestamps of the absolute time and can therefore be aligned accordingly.

\subsection{Data organization}
The projects tri-axial accelerometer data is stored in comma separated files as well as binary files, where both types have been named semi-automatically by the accelerometer data acquisition software and the person conducting the experiment, who gave mother-infant pairs their unique id, which had three different endings corresponding to the three accelerometer monitors, the mothers wrist monitor, infants torso monitor and infants ankle monitor. As the file names did not contain any identifier regarding the type of data and could not be ordered to represent the sequence of subjects, symbolic links were created with the help of a list provided by the person conducting the experiment, which contained the full file names with the corresponding label of the data they contain. Mother-infant pairs who had missing one or both infants measurements were excluded from the further analysis. This resulted in 28 mother-infant pairs and 2 infants only, whose corresponding files, containing the three or two measurements, were named \texttt{n\_infant\_torso}, \texttt{n\_infant\_ankle} and \texttt{n\_mother}, where n...1:30.

\subsection{Timestamp alignment}
The accelerometers were attached upon a visit at a clinic. Besides a few exceptions, accelerometers were set to start recording before being attached and were attached to the mothers wrist, infants torso and infants ankle one after the other. This resulted in different start timestamps. In order to ensure proper analysis, the measurements needed to be aligned so that for each mother-infant pair, all three measurements had the same start timestamp.\\
The alignment was done in a Python script that loaded and read all three files belonging to the measurements of each mother-infant pair, processed the data and saved the results. Files were loaded using the module \textit{pandas}. The timestamps of the accelerometer were in the YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:ffff format and were parsed with the module \textit{dateutil} which enables the resulting parsed timestamps to be simply compared with each other. The latest start timestamp was determined and converted back into the appropriate format with \textit{strftime} from the \textit{os} module. This timestamp was then located in the rest of the measurements which were truncated up to that index. The resulting three measurements were aligned according to the absolute timestamp and were saved, again using the module \textit{pandas}.

As the infant and maternal accelerometers did not start measuring at the exact same time, the corresponding set of accelerometer data for each mother-infant pair needed to be aligned according to timestamps, to ensure they represent accelerations recorded at the same time. This was followed by data preprocessing, which started with removal of the data points belonging to the time when the accelerometer was not actually worn (i.e. non-wear time). Long durations of non-wear time could impose a low PA value due to the lack of accelerations in the overall measured time frame. The beginning and end timestamps of the detected non-wear blocks were validated against the diary notations of accelerometer removal and reattachment. 

The next step required a summary measure to be extracted. For this purpose, data from each of the three axes were first filtered with a median filter of width 11, then 1 was subtracted from the Euclidean norm of all three axes and in the end the measure was averaged over 0.2 second windows, similar as done in previous analysis[2].

The project report ends with a discussion and conclusions regarding estimations of infants PA and the feasibility of estimating infants PA by placing two accelerometers on the infant in order to correct for the contributions of the caretaker. 


Having such contributions towards the overall acceleration, one has to extract PA with caution as the acceleration signal processing can be impaired and the final result could wrongly reflect subjects PA.

. Since the final PA variable is the result of the accelerations over the time of experiment, long durations of non-wear time would result in a low PA value in a subject that could have been very active otherwise. Therefore careful accelerometer signal preprocessing is necessary, starting with removal of data where the accelerometer was not worn. 


With exception for the accelerometer placed on the infants ankle, the accelerometers could be removed and reattached. Mothers were asked to note such non-wear time in the diary. Prior to diary examination, non-wear time was detected automatically with a Pyhton script. The diary notations were then used for validation of the results. The Python script was designed based on previous approaches towards non-wear time removal[2]. The principal idea of the approach is to examine the standard deviation(SD hereafter) and the span between minimum and maximum of a windowed measurement and remove windows where the SD and span are below a specified threshold. To increase accuracy, the baseline of the windowed measurement is also examined in this project. When the accelerometer is not worn by the subject, it should only be picking up acceleration due to gravitation which is constant. As a consequence, the measurement of non-wear time should in theory have none or very little SD, the span between the minimum value and the maximum value should be close to zero and the baseline of the measurement should be a flat line without any drift or jumps. But in practice, one cannot rely fully on these assumptions. All accelerometers have   inherent noise, for the accelerometer used in the current project (GENEA), it has been shown that the SD of a motionless device is 2.6 mg. Other factors can also contribute towards the increased SD, since being in a free living environment, the accelerometers are liable to pick up the movement from the environment, even if only the surface on which it rests is being bumped into. On the other hand, if the accelerometer is not placed on the torso, it will not pick up accelerations due to heartbeats and chest movements from breathing, and can therefore appear as non-wear time when the subject is actually sleeping very still. All this has to be taken into consideration when extracting and removing the data of non-wear time and several parameters need to be set which greatly affect the final outcome. For this reason, some parameters were left to be passed on to the script upon run time in order to enable trial and examination. These parameters were: 
Window length 
SD threshold 
Span between minimum and maximum threshold 
Amount of data to be processed
These parameters are read with the module sys. Data is loaded and read with the module pandas. Each of the three axes  are filtered with a median filter of width 11, using medfilt from module scipy.signal. The measurement is windowed with a loop. For each window, SD and span between minimum and maximum is calculated. If these values are below the set thresholds, a line is fitted through the accelerometer data points of the window with the help of polyfit from the module numpy. The slope of the line should be near to zero. The value of 1e-07 was chosen as the threshold and if the absolute value of the slope was below that threshold, the window was classified as non-wear time. The data along with the results were plotted using module matplotlib and printed in the terminal, example in Figure 1.
Upon trial, examination and previously set cut points, the window length was set to 30 minutes, which corresponds to 72000 data points. Shorter windows were more prone to classify time windows of sleeping as non-wear time, whereas larger windows failed to detect short duration of non-wear time. SD threshold was set to 0.002 g and minimum to maximum span threshold was set to 0.015 g. The last parameter left to be specified upon run time was set to a small amount of data for quick trial and examination and was later set to full 48 hours. To increase accuracy even further, a more detailed windowed examination was performed around the edges to better detect the borders   of the blocks of non-wear time, and up to three windows of in between blocks of non-wear time were set as non-wear. 
Upon final inspection of the results and their plots, all visually apparent non-wear blocks were detected, with a few minor blocks that were likely to be sleeping blocks based on the time of occurrence. All together 12 out of 30 infants had non-wear time detected on the torso monitor, with an average of 8.6% of data being removed with minimum 1.2% and maximum 31.1%. One of the infants had also had the ankle monitor removed at the end of the 48 hour time period.
The final blocks of non-wear time were removed from all measurements in the infants non-wear time and in mothers only in case of mothers non-wear time. The start and end timestamps of non-wear blocks were saved to enable validation against the diaries. 



Accelerometers can be designed to measure acceleration on a single axis, dual axes or three axes along with different sampling rates. For the accelerometer used in this project, it had been shown that sampling frequencies larger than 10 Hz and/or more than one axis did not significantly increase classification accuracy, when classifying 10-12 semistructured activities performed in the laboratory or an outdoor environment, while wearing the accelerometer on the right wrist[7]. As for the PA extraction step, the same requirements for accuracy should be justifiable, but when considering detection and extraction of accelerations due to the infant being moved, it might be useful to analyze data in each of the three axes separately. However, there is no training data available that could serve as the key information regarding the way accelerations are detected in the three axes when the infant is being moved. If such data were present, one could model these accelerations, and perhaps having three axes would prove to be useful to better detect such accelerations in new data. In this project, the accelerations contributed by the caretaker had to be detected and corrected based solely on the data from the two monitors worn by the infant. The way the ankle and torso monitors were placed, the three axes of the two monitors were not aligned and with the mobility of the infants ankle they were liable to rotations. This presents a problem when one wants to compare the two outputs, since each of the axes should be aligned prior to the analysis. For such reasons, a summary measure was extracted as explained above(?), which represented the output summarized over all three axes along with filtering and averaging.
The summary measure was calculated in Matlab by subtracting one from the averaged Euclidean norm of the three axes which were filtered with a median filter in a similar way as done in previous analysis[2], since it had been shown, that having more complicated summaries does not significantly improve the final extraction of PA[3]. The width of the median filter was 11 and its purpose was to remove any spikes from the measurement which are due to noise. The resulting Euclidean norm minus one was averaged over 0.2 seconds to further smooth the data and minimize the contribution of noise. When plotting the resulting summary measure for torso and ankle, one can  clearly see the substantial similarities in the measurements due to the caretakers contributions, example in Figure 2. 






Accelerations contributed by the caretakers


In 2009 a paper titled \textit{Mechanical Measurement of Infant Activity: A Cautionary Note} \cite{ref1} was published. The main message of the paper was that much of infants measured activity may be confounded by their caretakers contributions. An experiment was performed as a basis for the paper, where a mother and her 3 month old infant had a normal 24 hour day with usual activities, while a researcher with a motionless doll would mimic everything the mother did with her infant. Both the infant and the doll wore motion loggers on the chest and ankle. The results were then analyzed and compared. As one would expect, the dolls measurement showed a substantial amount of activity which would normally be unusual for a motionless doll. When comparing infants activity levels to the ones of the doll, approximately 45\% more activity was detected, meaning that the monitor will pick up both, the infants and caretakers contributions. In 2014 a PhD thesis was submitted, titled \textit{Physical activity in infancy: assessment of an intervention to increase physical activity in infants}\cite{ref6}. As part of the research, the defended studied and analyzed the feasibility to assess PA in 6-month old infants using an accelerometer, based on a validation study performed in 2012, with the results available in a conference abstract\cite{ref5}. The goal of the study was to assess the degree of caregiver confounding that might be expected in these measurements. Similar to before \cite{ref1}, the infants and motionless dolls wore three accelerometers, one on the wrist, one on the ankle and one on the waist. While the caretaker would perform several activities with the infant, the research assistant would mimic their actions with the doll. Overall 34 mother-infant pairs participated, although some did not perform all the activities. The results showed that when the infant is pushed in a stroller, 29\% of the arm movement and 9\% of the leg movement is due to contributing accelerations, while when being carried, contributing accelerations add up to 23\% of the arm movement and 52\% of the leg movement. With another type of activity with a Swiss ball, 28\% of the arm movement and 21\% of the leg movement was due to contributing accelerations. For all activities, the waist accelerometer recorded more activity on the doll rather then the infant, which resulted in an invalid measurement. An interesting observation showed that the overall output differed significantly between the three differently placed accelerometers, when in fact recording the \textit{same} activity. Overall, the study\cite{ref5} showed that up to half of the detected activity can be due to contributing accelerations, while these contributions differ significantly between the activities performed and between the differently placed monitors, as well as between the caretakers.\\
The overall variability presents a potential problem as it is currently still unexplained, making modeling of such data impaired. In the current project, the two monitors were placed on different body parts of the infant, as well as on the mothers wrist, to enable correction due to contributing accelerations. But when the two monitors have different outcomes for the same activity and the variability between the subjects is high, the correction becomes complicated. This is even further complicated by the fact that a monitor placed on infants torso is liable to record accelerations that are not due to infant being moved and are therefor not recorded on the ankle monitor, even though the infants at 4 month are not able to move their torso. It had been shown that the movement of the chest while breathing has an amplitude of 10 mg, while heart beating will result in an amplitude of 80 mg\cite{ref8}. With such sensitivity, infants crying and flexing, along with limb movement should also be picked up by the torso monitor.






Prior all approaches, apparent periods where the infant was being moved were extracted, based on the substantially increased SD in both, torso and ankle placed measurement. This periods were used to asses the different results from the different approaches. Blocks of \textit{infant being moved} were detected similar as in non-wear detection. Example of these blocks noted in both measurements in Figure 5.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=8cm]{final_plotE.png}
\caption{Example of the torso and ankle placed measurements, where blocks of \textit{infant being moved} are noted with red.}
\end{figure}
\\\\Based on these blocks, several variables were calculated. The overall proportion of time the infant was being moved and frequency of infant being moved, along with eight more detailed variables. Detailed variables are proportions of time in combining short and long duration with low and high intensity blocks along with the frequency. Overall, infants were being moved by another person on average 35.0\% of the time, with minimum at 21.0\%, maximum at 45.4\% and SD 5.9\%. 
\\As predicted, \textbf{A} did not give promising results, as the point to point difference was too significant, even though the measurements were summarized, filtered and averaged and showed substantial similarities on a large scale. Simple subtraction in fact amplified the contributing accelerations, as the average SD in the apparent blocks of \textit{infant being moved} increased by an average of 15.0\% while the average absolute intensity increased by average 20.5\%.

Even when averaging the measurement over 1 second, instead of 0.2, the average SD still increased by average 14.9\% and the average intensity by average 18.3\%.



In both approaches, the measurement is even further summarized and again the parameter representing the length of the window influences the final result. Short windows might preserve the local differences between the two monitors, while long windows might over summarize the data, especially if used further for PA extraction. Since training data is not present, such parameters have to be set by trial and examination, which is time consuming and the quality of the result is subjective. \\
In approach \textbf{B}, the outcome used for future PA extraction is more summarized then in other approaches.
This could influence the result of the extraction, since PA detection is limited down to a summary of a minute which makes it less accurate. This is avoided in the approach \textbf{C}, which in compare to approach \textbf{A}, decreases the average SD and absolute intensity of the apparent \textit{infant being moved} blocks by average of 43.9\% and 47.3\% of the original SD and original intensities respectively.




One of the basic issues with such an approach is that without a well defined training data set, we can not be certain that the underlying similarity between the measurements is due to contributing accelerations from the caretaker. The vibrations from infants kicking movement could be picked up by the torso placed monitor and might exhibit similarity with the ankle placed monitor although the least will have a substantial amount of additional accelerations. Second, we can not be sure whether in windows, where the two measurements would appear to be uncorrelated, there is an absence of contributing accelerations from the caretaker or these were just recorded so significantly different. A methodological issue is also presented by the estimation of significance and validity of the derived Pearsons correlation coefficient. Statistical inference tests, for Pearson's correlation coefficient commonly used in population studies, require a few assumptions to be met. Principally they are sensitive to the data distribution and require the data to be normally distributed, otherwise the results could be misleading. With each window of a windowed measurement, we are only interested in that particular window and no general hypothesis is attempted to be proven about the data from which the sample was taken from, but rather just the descriptive statistics are being compared. For that reason, a simple permutation test should be a better estimation rather than using the Fisher transformation, which is most used in practice and in computer languages as well as statistics tools. For such reason, the necessary prior testing for the assumption of normality can be left out, as it is unlikely that it will be met by the accelerometer data distribution, which is skewed and distorted most of the time. While one would commonly use a Spear mans rank-order correlation in cases where the data is not normally distributed, this is not appropriate in the case of comparing the similarity of two time-series as comparing the orders of ranked time points would not make sense. Nevertheless, simple Pearsons correlation coefficient and the corresponding level of significance derived with the permutation test will not always be as accurate as desired, especially in the presence of substantial additional accelerations and time lags in each of the two variables. Better methods around these issues had been developed and purposed\cite{ref11}\cite{ref12}\cite{ref13}, but the level of complexity exceeds the one set for this project. 



one has to consider the degree of measurement summarization, before calculating the correlation coefficient.



Average SD of the apparent \textit{infant being moved} blocks is decreased by an average of 57.9\% and the average absolute intensity by an average of 58.5\%. 



In approach \textbf{D} even more parameters had to be set, whose values have a great effect on the final outcome. Without a training data set, these parameters were again set by trial and examination and their optimum is uncertain.
Along with the basic issues present, approach \textbf{D} is still not certain enough and one would like to extract PA without having to consider whether the correction for the contributing accelerations was accurate enough. This leads to the final approach \textbf{E}, where all the blocks detected as \textit{infant being moved} are simply removed from the measurement and are therefore excluded from the future extraction of PA. Example of these blocks in Figure 5.


Mothers characteristics in pregnancy, along with the infants characteristics post-partum, can provide significant information when studying fetal programming\cite{ref14}\cite{ref15}\cite{ref16}. Infants at 4 months post-partum will not yet have been substantially exposed to and influenced by the environment outside the intrauterine environment, especially when it comes to PA, which is still completely instinct at that point and can there for be considered \textit{pre-programmed}.
By being able to accurately estimate infants PA, many research questions could be addressed. 
\\Although accelerometers are commonly used to estimate subjects PA, there are several issues that can lead to incorrect or uncertain results that disable further analysis. When estimating infants PA with accelerometers, the major issue is represented by the contributing accelerations of the infants caretaker. In this project, several approaches to correct for these contributions were implemented and analyzed. Different outcomes of different approaches are used to extract PA and the results are compared and further analyzed.


\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=6.5cm]{CorrectedIntensitiesCorrelation.png}
\caption{An example of windowed absolute intensities obtained from the first summary derivations of torso and ankle placed measurements (I) and different results from approach \textbf{B} (II) and \textbf{D} (III) regarding the windowed absolute intensities, which are no longer negative in approach \textbf{D}.}
\end{figure}

Since approach \textbf{C} is based on the same principle as \textbf{B}, they will possess the same degree of inaccuracy on a certain level. The difference is, that in approach \textbf{C}, PA extraction can be done with more precision as the measurement is not summarized into intensities and even though, subtractions causing negative intensities, have the same inaccurate effect, PA extraction might not be so influenced by it, as it might not contribute so substantially to the SD of a certain window. Results of PA extraction based on the approach \textbf{C} in Figure 15.

\\
Based on approach \textbf{D}, PA can be extracted from the measurement in a form of absolute intensities or in a form of the original summary. Example of PA extraction from absolute intensities based on approach \textbf{D} in Figure 16 and example of PA extraction from the original summary in Figure 17. 



In both cases, one can observe less left overs of the contributing accelerations and in the first case PA is extracted more accurately than in approach \textbf{B} since there are no more negative subtracted intensities left. Nevertheless, PA can be extracted with more precision when the measurement is in the form of the original summary, so when considering approach \textbf{D}, only that result will be further analyzed.
Last approach is approach \textbf{E}, where all the apparent blocks of \textit{infant being moved} are simply removed from the measurement and only the rest is used to extract PA. Example of the result in Figure 18, where the \textit{infant being moved} blocks are marked red and the infant PA green.


PA was extracted from the corrected or remaining measurements, after removal of data points of non-wear time, summarization, correction for the gravitational component and the correction for \textit{infant being moved}. In approaches where the result of the \textit{infant being moved} correction is in the form of the original summary, PA is extracted based on the increased SD in a windowed measurement. Window size was set to 10 seconds, which corresponds to 400 data points and the step size was set to 1 seconds, which corresponds to 40 data points. SD threshold was set to 0.005 g. The results from the approach \textbf{A} are not used for PA extraction, as they are obviously not suitable. In the approach \textbf{B}, the result is in a form of subtracted absolute intensities, which can be negative due to inadequacy of the approach. Extracting PA from the intensities can be done by setting a threshold for the intensity size, defining all intensities over that threshold as due to PA. When extracting PA based on the results from approach \textbf{B}, one can observe the results are not going to be accurate, example Figure 14. There are obvious left-overs from the contributing accelerations, which are now detected as infants PA, while the negative intensities disrupt the PA blocks.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=7cm]{SubtractedIntensitiesPA.png}
\caption{PA extraction after approach \textbf{B} exhibits the consequences of the negative features of the approach.}
\end{figure}
\\
Since approach \textbf{C} is based on the same principle as \textbf{B}, they will possess the same degree of inaccuracy on a certain level. The difference is, that in approach \textbf{C}, PA extraction can be done with more precision as the measurement is not summarized into intensities and even though, subtractions causing negative intensities, have the same inaccurate effect, PA extraction might not be so influenced by it, as it might not contribute so substantially to the SD of a certain window. Results of PA extraction based on the approach \textbf{C} in Figure 15.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=7cm]{CorrectedIntensitiesPA.png}
\caption{PA extraction after approach \textbf{C}.}
\end{figure}
\\
Based on approach \textbf{D}, PA can be extracted from the measurement in a form of absolute intensities or in a form of the original summary. Example of PA extraction from absolute intensities based on approach \textbf{D} in Figure 16 and example of PA extraction from the original summary in Figure 17. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=7cm]{CorrectedIntensitiesCorrelationResultPA.png}
\caption{PA extraction from absolute intensities, based on approach \textbf{D}.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=7cm]{CorrectedCorrelationResultPA.png}
\caption{PA extraction from the original summary, based on approach \textbf{D}.}
\end{figure}

In both cases, one can observe less left overs of the contributing accelerations and in the first case PA is extracted more accurately than in approach \textbf{B} since there are no more negative subtracted intensities left. Nevertheless, PA can be extracted with more precision when the measurement is in the form of the original summary, so when considering approach \textbf{D}, only that result will be further analyzed.
Last approach is approach \textbf{E}, where all the apparent blocks of \textit{infant being moved} are simply removed from the measurement and only the rest is used to extract PA. Example of the result in Figure 18, where the \textit{infant being moved} blocks are marked red and the infant PA green.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=6.5cm]{approachEPA.png}
\caption{PA extraction from the remaining original summary, where all the \textit{infant being moved} blocks had been removed.}
\end{figure}


Overall, the proportion of time the infant was in PA differed between the various approaches. One could already expect that extracting and analyzing PA based on the approach A will be meaningless, as the majority of accelerations present are still due to infant being moved. In fact, when comparing the proportion of time infant is supposed to spent in PA based on approach A, to the proportion of time the infant was being moved, over all subjects, Spearmans rank correlation coefficients results in 0.84 with p-value 0, example in Figure 19.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=9cm, height=9cm]{PAAIBM.jpg}
\caption{Comparing the proportion of time in PA after approach \textbf{A} and proportion of time infant was being moved, over all subjects.}
\end{figure}
\\
This makes sense, as PA and \textit{infant being moved} blocks are extracted with the same procedure, using a slightly different SD cutpoint. Considering this, along with the observation, that subtraction does not remove contributing accelerations, but in fact enhances them, it is not surprising these proportions end up being very similar. With approaches \textbf{B} and \textbf{C} better results can be expected. PA extraction based on approach \textbf{B} resulted in infant being in PA on an average of 34.3\% of his 'own time', with min 23.0\%, max 45.0\% and SD 5.4\%, while based on approach \textbf{C}, infant was in PA on an average 32.5\% of his 'own time', with min 21.9\%, max 42.0\% and SD 4.8\%. \\These numbers are similar, although one would expect them to differ more, since first approach extracts PA from subtracted absolute intensities that can be negative. One explanation could be that these errors even out and by averaging over the subjects, the final outcome will be similar, example of a boxplot of the two extracted PA values over all subjects in Figure 20.

 When examining these numbers along with the proportion of time the infant was being moved, plots still exhibit slight correlation between the two variables, with exception of a few outliers, example in Figure 21.

Over all subjects, the proportion of time in PA after approach \textbf{B} and the proportion of time the infant was being moved produced a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient of 0.48 with p-value 0.0072, while with the proportion of time in PA after approach \textbf{C} the coefficient was 0.64 with p-value \textit{2e-04}. One could speculate that such correlation is due to the left overs of the contributing accelerations, although there is a chance that caretakers influence infants own PA by interaction.
Moving on to approach \textbf{D}, PA extraction resulted in an average of 25.5\% of infants 'own time', with min 12.3\%, max 47.6\% and SD 0.09\%. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient for the comparison of the proportion of time in PA after approach \textbf{D} and the proportion of time the infant was being moved resulted in 0.41 with a p-value 0.0236. Scatterplot of proportion of time in PA vs. proportion of time being moved in Figure 22.\\

Although there is less significant correlation then in previous approaches, there is still a substantial amount, but again with uncertainty, whether this due to the contributing accelerations, same procedure of extraction, or caretakers interference. So far, all the extracted PA variables were liable to be confounded by the contributing accelerations. With the last approach, one would expect to have no correlation with the proportion of the time infant was moved, since it had all been removed and the final PA variable should not be confounded. \\
While the resulting proportion of time the infant was in PA, based on approach \textbf{E}, was on average 19.4\% with minimum 12.8\%, maximum 26.0\% and SD 3.2\%, when correlating the proportion of time in PA with the proportion of time being moved, Spearmans rank correlation coefficient results in -0.42 with p-value 0.0218. The sign and quantity of correlation imply that there is a negative relationship between the two. Scatterplot of the proportion of time in PA vs. proportion of time being moved in Figure 23. Considering only the methodological reasons for this implication, one could speculate that by removing all the parts where the infant was being moved, in a short time period of 48 hours, will result in very little measurement left for the infants PA to be detected. Keeping in mind the infants at 4 month old age are very dependent on the caretaker, especially while awake, one can also speculate, the majority of measurement left after approach \textbf{E} will belong to the time when infant was sleeping. Such interference could leave consequences, even if the final PA variable is normalized with the amount of time left after the approach. More can be explored and validated with the help of diaries, kept by the infants mothers. This is discussed in the next chapter, where the rest of the extracted variables are also analyzed.
