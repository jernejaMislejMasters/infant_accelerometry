<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">The tri-axial accelerometer data was obtained in the </span><span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-112">Energy balance and health in pregnancy</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">project, a pre-pilot project for the </span><span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-112">LifeGene Study </span><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">(</span><a 
href="http://www.lifegene.se" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1095">http://www.lifegene.se</span></a><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">). One of the aims</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">of the pre-pilot project was to assess the feasibility of estimating physical activity(PA</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">hereafter) in young infants in order to associate lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">post-partum markers of cardiometabolic health in the infant. An extensive collection of</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">characteristics was measured and obtained, including infants and mothers tri-axial</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerometer data and infants sleeping and feeding diaries. The accelerometer data was</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">recorded in a free living environment for 48 hours using a GENEA monitor(UniLever Ltd),</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">sampled at 40 Hz and stored in g units. The diary consist of printed forms which the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">mothers filled out for 5 consecutive days from midnight of the second day on, example in</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">Supplements.</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">In this project, the focus was on the estimation of infants PA along with the discussion and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">assessment of the feasibility regarding such an estimation.</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">Although accelerometers are increasingly being used for PA estimations in population</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">studies, their output needs to be interpreted with caution. Due to its properties and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">sensitivity, the accelerometer is prone to pick up accelerations not related to the PA of the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">subject wearing it. In measurements taken of adults, these are mainly due to gravitation and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">instrumentation noise, but in infants and smaller children who are less or not mobile in</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">terms of walking, the caretaker attributes greatly to the acceleration by carrying or</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">placing the child[1]. By not correcting for such contributions, the extracted infants PA</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">would incorrectly present those infants that are moved around more as being more</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">active.</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">For that purpose, the pre-pilot project was designed to place two accelerometers on the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">infant, one on the torso, other on the ankle. The idea behind this was that the infant at 4</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">month old age can not move his torso on his own, so any large accelerations measured on</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the torso would consequently mean that the infant was being moved at that time. On the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">other hand, the infant can move his legs, so having accelerations detected on the ankle</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">monitor, but not on the torso, would mean the infant is being active himself. At the same</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">time, the mothers, who were the main caretakers of the infants, also wore a wrist</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerometer and kept a diary of feeding and sleeping habits of the infant, as well as other</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">important information concerning the infant and the experiment. In order to analyze and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">process all this information, the tri-axial accelerometer data needed to be prepared and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">preprocessed. The first and basic task was to organize the data which is stored in comma</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">separated files as well as binary files in order to enable same analysis to be performed</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">for all subjects or mother-infant pairs. Then for each mother-infant pair and the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">corresponding set of accelerometers, the measurements needed to be aligned according to</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the timestamp, to ensure they represent accelerations recorded at the same time</span>
                                                                                  <img 
src="BINP25_report7x.png" alt="PICT" >
<img 
src="BINP25_report8x.png" alt="PICT" >
                                                                                  
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">point, since the three accelerometers did not start measuring at the exact same</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">time. This was followed by data preprocessing, which started with removal of</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the data points belonging to the time when the accelerometer was not actually</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">worn. Long durations of non-wear time could impose a low PA value due to the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">lack of accelerations in the overall measured time frame. The beginning and end</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">timestamps of the detected non-wear blocks were validated against the diary notations of</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerometer removal and reattachment. The next step required a summary measure to be</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">extracted. For this purpose, the data from each of the three axis was first filtered with a</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">median filter of width 11, then 1 was subtracted from the Euclidean norm of all three</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">axis and in the end the measure was averaged over 0.2 second windows, similar</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">as done in previous analysis[2]. The subtracted 1 represents an estimation of the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">gravitational component, since the acceleration output is measured in </span><span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-112">g</span><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">s, where 1g</span>
<span 
class="zplmr7y-x-x-112">&#x2243;</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">9.81 m/s2. But as analyzed and discussed in previous papers[3], removing the gravitational</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">component is not so simple, especially when rotational movements are present. In this</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">project, this problem was approached with the signal baseline correction method[4], which</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">preserves all the amplitudes, but corrects the signal baseline drifts or displacements.</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">The final step of preprocessing was to correct for the accelerations contributed by</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the caretaker. Besides one published paper[1] and a PhD thesis[6] along with a</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">conference abstract[5], this issue has not yet been researched and therefor has no</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">established approach of solving. For this reason, various approaches were tested in</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">this project. From simple subtraction of accelerations measured at torso from the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerations measured on the ankle, to still simple but more advanced approaches like</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">subtracting the windowed intensities or using the windowed intensities to reduce the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">acceleration values in the ankle measurement, to more complicated attempts of correction</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">by extracting windowed signal similarities between the measurements of torso</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">and ankle, along with the approach where all the blocks detected as infant being</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">moved are simply excluded from the further analysis and PA extraction. Each</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">approach has its problems and negative features which expose the nature of the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerometer output taken of an infant from monitors placed on different body</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">parts. Blocks, where infant was being moved, were approximated along with a</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">set of variables, representing the overall duration, intensity and frequency of the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">caretakers contributions. These variables were used to analyze the results from different</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">approaches and could as well be used as covariates in the future analysis of PA and the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">correlation with other characteristics. The results were also compared with the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">diary notations of sleeping and feeding habits with an intention of validation.</span>
<br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">From the remaining or corrected measurements, the PA was extracted and again compared</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">against the diary notations of sleeping habits, with the intention to examine the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">overall activity, specifically whether it is present more during infants awake time as</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">expected. The project report ends with a discussion and conclusions regarding</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">estimations of infants PA and the feasibility of estimating infants PA by placing</span>
                                                                                  <img

class="pplr9e-x-x-112">When conducting analysis over a complex dataset, where the subjects are in fact two or more</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">paired individuals or a combination of their measures that require preprocessing, the dataset</span>

<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">representing the individual subject of the analysis. Usually that simply means</span>
<span

<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">The nature of an accelerometer is that it will pick up any movement of the monitor,</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">regardless whether the movement is due to PA of the subject wearing it or due to the subject</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">being moved or carried, or even due to just readjustment of the monitor. As objects on the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">surface of earth are always under the influence of gravitation, the accelerometer</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">will also measure acceleration due to gravity, except if it is in free fall. Having</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">such contributions towards the overall acceleration, one has to extract PA with</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">caution as the acceleration signal processing can be impaired and the final result</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">could wrongly reflect subjects PA. Issues also arise from accelerometer non-wear</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">time. Since the final PA variable is the result of the accelerations over the time of</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">experiment, long durations of non-wear time would result in a low PA value in a subject</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">that could have been very active otherwise. Therefore careful accelerometer signal</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">preprocessing is necessary, starting with removal of data where the accelerometer was not</span>
<span

<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">Except for the accelerometer placed on the infants ankle, the accelerometers could had been</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">removed and reattached. Mothers were asked to note such non-wear time in the diary. Prior</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">to diary examination, non-wear time was detected automatically with a Pyhton script. The</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">diary notations were then used for validation of the results. The Python script was</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">designed based on previous approaches towards non-wear time removal[2]. The</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">principal idea of the approach is to examine the standard deviation(SD hereafter)</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">and the span between minimum and maximum of a windowed measurement and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">remove those windows, where the SD and span are below a specific threshold. To</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">increase accuracy, the baseline of the windowed measurement is also examined in</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">this project. When the accelerometer is not worn by the subject, it should only be</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">picking up acceleration due to gravitation which is constant. As a consequence, the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">measurement of non-wear time should in theory have none or very little SD, the span</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">between the minimum value and the maximum value should be close to zero and the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">baseline of the measurement should be a flat line without any drift or jumps. But</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">in practice, one can not rely fully on these assumptions. All accelerometers have</span>
                                                                                  <img

<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">inherent noise, for the accelerometer used in the project, it had been shown that the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">SD of a motionless device is 2.6 mg. Other factors can also contribute towards</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the increased SD, since being in a free living environment, the accelerometers are</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">liable to pick up the movement from the environment, even if only the surface</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">on which it rests is being bumped in to. On the other hand, if the accelerometer</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">is not placed on the torso, it will not be picking up the accelerations due to the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">heartbeat and chest movement from breathing and can therefor appear to be in</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">non-wear time when the subject is actually just sleeping very still. All this has to</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">be taken into consideration when extracting and removing the data of non-wear</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">time and several parameters need to be set whose value have a great effect on the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">final outcome. For this reason some parameters were left to be passed on to the</span>

<span

<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">information regarding the way accelerations are detected in the three axis when the</span>

<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">regardless if the subject is in PA or is being moved by another person. Infants at 4 month old</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">age are completely dependent on the caretaker. Besides the basic tasks like feeding, bathing,</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">dressing, etc., the infants at 4 months require a substantial amount of carrying, placing and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">cradling. This results in significant contributions of accelerations caused by the person caring</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">for the infant. In 2009 a paper titled </span><span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-112">Mechanical Measurement of Infant Activity: A</span>
<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-112">Cautionary Note</span><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">[1] was published. The main message of the paper was that much of</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">infants measured activity may be confounded by their caretakers contributions. An</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">experiment was performed as a basis for the paper, where a mother and her 3 month old</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">infant had a normal 24 hour day with usual activities, while a researcher with a</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">motionless doll would mimic everything the mother did with her infant. Both</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the infant and the doll wore motion loggers on the chest and ankle. The results</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">were then analyzed and compared. As one would expect, the dolls measurement</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">showed a substantial amount of activity which would normally be unusual for a</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">motionless doll. When comparing infants activity levels to the ones of the doll,</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">approximately 45% more activity was detected, meaning that the monitor will</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">pick up both, the infants and caretakers contributions. In 2014 a PhD thesis was</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">submitted, titled </span><span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-112">Physical activity in infancy: assessment of an intervention to increase physical</span>
<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-112">activity in infants</span><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">[6]. As part of the research, the defended studied and analyzed the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">feasibility to assess PA in 6-month old infants using an accelerometer, based on</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">a validation study performed in 2012, with the results available in a conference</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">abstract[5]. The goal of the study was to assess the degree of caregiver confounding that</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">might be expected in these measurements. Similar to before[1], the infants and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">motionless dolls wore three accelerometers, one on the wrist, one on the ankle and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">one on the waist. While the caretaker would perform several activities with the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">infant, the research assistant would mimic their actions with the doll. Overall 34</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">mother-infant pairs participated, although some did not perform all the activities.</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">The results showed that when the infant is pushed in a stroller, 29% of the arm</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">movement and 9% of the leg movement is due to contributing accelerations, while</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">when being carried, contributing accelerations add up to 23% of the arm movement</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">and 52% of the leg movement. With another type of activity with a Swiss ball,</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">28% of the arm movement and 21% of the leg movement was due to contributing</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerations. For all activities, the waist accelerometer recorded more activity on the doll</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">rather then the infant, which resulted in an invalid measurement. An interesting</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">observation showed that the overall output differed significantly between the three</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">differently placed accelerometers, when in fact recording the </span><span

class="pplr9e-x-x-112">activity. Overall, the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">study[5] showed that up to half of the detected activity can be due to contributing</span>
<span

<span

<span

<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">outcomes for the same activity and the variability between the subjects is high, the correction</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">becomes complicated. This is even further complicated by the fact that a monitor</span>
<span

<span

<span

class="pplr9e-x-x-112">same activity performed by the caretaker with the infant is recorded differently by</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">differently placed monitors, there should be a scaling factor involved when doing such</span>

<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">had also been shown that different activities result in different ratios between the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">differently placed monitors, as well as that there is a high variability between the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">subjects. Things get even more complicated if considering the fact that the two</span>

<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">crying, breathing, heart beat or kicking. Without having a well defined training</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">dataset it is difficult to tell which of the remaining accelerations left after approaches</span>

class="pplr9e-x-x-112">and </span><span 
class="pplb9e-x-x-112">C </span><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">are due to the excessive detection of contributing accelerations on the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">ankle placed monitor or due to infants PA. Nevertheless, the approaches can be</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">improved. The overall concept of subtracting implies that the torso placed monitor will</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">record accelerations equal or smaller then the ankle placed one, as well as that the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">degree of correction is dependent on the ratio of intensity instead of similarity. If</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">similarity between the intensities is obtained, it can be used as an approximation</span>
<span

class="pplr9e-x-x-112">One of the basic issues with such an approach is that without a well defined training data</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">set, we can not be certain that the underlying similarity between the measurements is due to</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">contributing accelerations from the caretaker. The vibrations from infants kicking movement</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">could be picked up by the torso placed monitor and might exhibit similarity with the ankle</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">placed monitor although the least will have a substantial amount of additional</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerations. Second, we can not be sure whether in windows, where the two</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">measurements would appear to be uncorrelated, there is an absence of contributing</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">accelerations from the caretaker or these were just recorded so significantly different.</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">A methodological issue is also presented by the estimation of significance and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">validity of the derived Pearsons correlation coefficient. Statistical inference tests, for</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">Pearsons correlation coefficient commonly used in population studies, require a few</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">assumptions to be met. Principally they are sensitive to the data distribution and require</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the data to be normally distributed, otherwise the results could be misleading.</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">With each window of a windowed measurement, we are only interested in that</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">particular window and no general hypothesis is attempted to be proven about</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the data from which the sample was taken from, but rather just the descriptive</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">statistics are being compared. For that reason, a simple permutation test should be a</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">better estimation rather than using the Fisher transformation, which is most used in</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">practice and in computer languages as well as statistics tools. For such reason, the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">necessary prior testing for the assumption of normality can be left out, as it is</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">unlikely that it will be met by the accelerometer data distribution, which is skewed</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">and distorted most of the time. While one would commonly use a Spear mans</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">rank-order correlation in cases where the data is not normally distributed, this</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">is not appropriate in the case of comparing the similarity of two time-series as</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">comparing the orders of ranked time points would not make sense. Nevertheless, simple</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">Pearsons correlation coefficient and the corresponding level of significance derived</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">with the permutation test will not always be as accurate as desired, especially</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">in the presence of substantial additional accelerations and time lags in each of</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the two variables. Better methods around these issues had been developed and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">purposed[11][12][13], but the level of complexity exceeds the one set for this project.</span>
<br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">As large differences, additional accelerations and time lags can still influence the correlation</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">coefficient, one has to consider the degree of measurement summarization, before</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">calculating the correlation coefficient. Even though Figure 8 and 9 exhibit similar</span>
<span

<!--l. 325--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">During the free living experiment, the mothers were instructed to keep a diary of the infants</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">feeding and sleeping habits, along with other valuable information regarding the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">experiment, like for example removal and reattachment of the accelerometer. All subjects</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">had the diary data available, except one, where the diary was missing. The diary</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">consisted of printed forms, example in Supplements. Besides a few exceptions,</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the mothers started keeping diary notations on the second day, from midnight</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">on. This already presents a drawback, since the accelerometer data was recorded</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">only for 48 hours from the morning of the first day on, meaning that out of those</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">48 hours, approximately 15 hours will not have corresponding diary notations.</span>
<br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">Since the diaries were filled by handwriting, the notations inside had to be digitized, to</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">enable automatic comparison and validation. Although one could attempt to achieve this</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">automatically by document scanning and image analysis, such approach would be</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">too complicated and time-consuming for the needs of this project, where only 30</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">documents had to processed. Therefor these documents were examined manually, which</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">was nevertheless still very time consuming and error prone. For several reasons,</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">a substantial amount of error was also introduced by the mothers keeping the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">notations. Mainly this was due to rounding up the noted time, having trouble</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">keeping up with notations and then not being able to recall the time of certain</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">occurrences.</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">First, the diary forms enabled notation of accelerometer removal and reattachment, where</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the mothers had to note which of the accelerometers is being taken off, corresponding</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">comments and the absolute time of removal and reattachment. Frequently, the mothers</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">commented that the accelerometer was forgotten to be put back on after removal and the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">times noted are therefor approximate. Secondly, the diary forms included a schedule over 24</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">hours, over a week, where the mothers were instructed to note the infants sleeping time with</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">a stroke. As one can see in the Supplements, the sleeping schedule is not so big, meaning</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">that the space for one hour is very small. Consequently, it was difficult for the mothers to</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">keep accurate and consistent notations of infants sleeping time. The noted times became</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">even less accurate, when the mothers forgot to note regularly and had to therefor</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">recall the approximate times of sleeping. For the validation and comparison of</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">data analysis, absolute timestamps were needed and had to be therefor created</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">manually, by examining these schedules, which introduced even more error. The</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">final timestamps were therefor liable to be very approximate and error prone and</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">one should begin to question whether comparison and validation against such</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">timestamps is useful and valid itself. Last, mothers were instructed to keep a diary</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">of infants feeding time, by noting down the begin time and duration of feeding,</span>
                                                                                  <img

<span

<!--l. 434--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">The torso and ankle placed measurements exhibit a substantial amount of similarity on a</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">large scale, which implies contributing accelerations due to infant being moved by the</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">caretaker. The overall presence of similarity and the amount of blocks with highly increased</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">SD of the torso placed measurement, correspond to the previous reports regarding</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">confounding accelerations due to infants caretaker[1][5][6]. High variability present between</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">the subjects and their characteristics is also observed as in previous reports. To</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">enable a valid extraction of infants PA, the contributing accelerations need to be</span>
<span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">removed. Based on the approaches developed and explored in this project, one has to</span>
<span

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">There  is  a  substantial  amount  of  difference  between  the  torso  and  ankle</span>

     <span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">measurement has to be derived,</span>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">The torso placed measurement is not necessary smaller then the ankle placed one,</span>
     <span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">so any kind of subtracting might result in impaired further analysis,</span>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="pplr9e-x-x-112">Extracting  signal  similarities  could  be  a  potentially  good  approach  to  correct</span>
